            Akula preprocesses data outside of the storage engine, making
            database write operations significantly faster. Is uses a staged
            synchronization technique which allows for rapid synchronization. It
            is written in Rust, leveraging a new Rust RVM interpreter evmodin,
            specifically designed for Akula to allow for asynchronous state
            access. Akula’s sync is split into stages, which allows for
            unprecedented parallelization of all major operations.

              All of this enables the new standard of performance, not seen in
              full nodes before.

            Akula beats Erigon client by 1.5–2 times on execution performance.
            Without building additional indexes, a full validation of Ethereum
            mainnet from genesis in can be completed in under 24h.
